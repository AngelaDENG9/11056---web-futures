## Project Reflection Report for Design Undergraduates

#### Theme Selection and Application of Artificial Intelligence
As a design student, I chose "Iceland" as the theme for my website design project due to its natural beauty and unique culture, which are visually appealing and ideal for showcasing my design skills. For this project, I utilized generative AI tools such as ChatGPT to assist with content generation. This not only saved time but also allowed me to focus more on the design itself. The AI-generated text content provided rich and accurate information for the website, making the entire design process more efficient.

#### Using Front-End Technology to Achieve Design Goals
My goal in this project was to create a responsive website that was both aesthetically pleasing and functional. To achieve this, I made extensive use of CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout design. These techniques allowed me to easily adapt elements to different screen sizes, ensuring that the site performed well on various devices. Additionally, I employed media queries to enhance the site's responsiveness, ensuring that each page maintained its layout and functionality across different viewport sizes.

#### Challenges and Solutions
During the development process, I encountered several significant challenges. The first was managing high-resolution images, which were slow to load and impacted the site's performance. To address this, I learned and applied image optimization techniques such as lazy loading and format conversion, which significantly improved page loading speeds. Another issue was cross-browser compatibility. Through actual testing and CSS adjustments, I resolved the problem of inconsistent display across different browsers.

#### Future Project Improvements
This project made me realize the importance of details in front-end design, such as loading speed and user interaction. In future projects, I plan to explore and apply advanced CSS and JavaScript features, such as animations and interactive effects, more thoroughly to enhance the user experience. Additionally, I recognize the importance of continuously learning new technologies, especially in the rapidly evolving field of web design. Furthermore, I will pay more attention to the accessibility and usability of the design to ensure that my website can serve all users.

Overall, this project has not only enhanced my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of design theories and fueled my enthusiasm and anticipation for future design work. Through reflection and lessons learned, I am confident that I will perform even better in upcoming design projects.
